Open [https://sara0alyahya.github.io/todo-list/](https://sara0alyahya.github.io/todo-list/) to view it in the browser.

### Difficulties:
- Having the user to delete one item of the list when it's checked. 
- Decide which color to go with, and the design in general

### Favorite Part: 
- Learning a new technology which is React, and getting to practice it.
